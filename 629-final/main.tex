\maketitle

Not a lot done in IT so quantitative makes more sense. Once more has been done, then qualitative and mixed methods can be used. There's been a lot done in computer science, but information technology is a more recent field and a foundational body of research is almost finished being put in place, but we still need more. And we're all super technical people so it makes more sense for us to work quantitatively. Now, I understand that qualitative research is different and hits different things, but we're generally not interested in those things. Most of our research is into hard facts about how students are performing, not about feelings and motivations; although those areas definitely need to be researched.

Notes from the teach:
Support claims and arguments.  Get rid of clunky sentences.
Have flowing logic - not just filled with all the things you remember. Your paper should be heading somewhere.

- Stick to one position and go on it
- Not a hauppauge of what you remember from the reading
- Everything heading to a conclusion
- Have a flow to it
* If you can't properly defend it - don't put it in
